# `django-admin startproject coolmonkey`

Right now I basically need to start the backend for the project cycle. Essentially just take some text data in json format from client. 
For now just take the string and save it in a text file.

Ok so fuck the text file. Now I need to take the text prompt and do something with it. 
Should I make a separate function that makes request to an API with some params or should I just make a whole ass inference API.
I get to dockerize the API and make like a microservice thing.

I don't fucking know let's just try to find an API first. I think I'll just do the separate function thing.
